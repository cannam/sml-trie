A persistent trie in Standard ML
================================

This is a fairly naive persistent (i.e. immutable) implementation of a
trie structure. A trie stores a set of entries, each of which is some
sort of vector or list, by indexing them by common prefix.

Membership can be tested quickly (as it can with a hash- or
tree-backed set), but one can also test quickly whether a prefix of a
given entry appears in the trie, find the longest prefix of an entry
that appears, and find all entries with a given prefix.

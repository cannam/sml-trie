A persistent trie in Standard ML
================================

This is a fairly naive immutable implementation of a trie.

A trie is an ordered set container. It stores a set of entries, each
of which is some sort of sequence (vector, list, string etc), filing
them into a tree structure internally according to their common
prefixes.

As with a hash set or tree-backed set structure, membership testing is
generally fast. Unlike hash and tree sets, a with a trie you can also
quickly test whether any prefix of a given entry appears in the trie,
obtain the longest such prefix, and find all entries with a given
prefix. Like a tree-backed set but not a hash set, a trie supports
enumerating the entries in order.

This implementation is naive in that it simply uses a red-black tree
map (from the SML/NJ library) at each node. This isn't all that memory
efficient and is also probably better suited to wide, shallow tries
than narrow, deep ones. The structure was originally written to
provide indexes for an RDF triple store.

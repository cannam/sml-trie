Trie and persistent trie-based containers in Standard ML
========================================================

This is a trie library in Standard ML.

The library contains implementations the following container
data structures:

   1. Trie and Trie Map
   2. Persistent Hash Map (implemented using bitmap tries)
   3. Persistent Array and Queue (implemented using bitmap tries)


1. TRIE AND TRIE MAP
--------------------

A trie is an ordered container. It stores a set of entries of a common
entry type, which is some sort of sequence (vector, list, string etc),
storing them in a tree structure according to their common prefixes,
branching where they diverge.

A trie can also support a map container, in which each entry (or key)
has an associated value rather than simply being present or absent. A
plain trie can also be expressed as a trie map whose "value" is of a
valueless (unit) type.

As with a hash map or typical tree-map structure, membership testing
is generally fast. Unlike those, with a trie you can also quickly test
whether any prefix of a given entry appears in the trie, obtain the
longest such prefix, and find all entries with a given prefix. Like a
tree-backed container but not a hash table, a trie is ordered, and can
be enumerated in the sort order of the entry type.

This library provides persistent or immutable trie containers, in the
sense that all updates return a separate trie, without modifying the
one passed in, but internally sharing any unmodified parts with it.

The main signatures are:

 * TRIE (trie.sig) - signature of a trie set container with arbitrary
   entry type

 * TRIE_MAP (trie-map.sig) - signature of a polymorphic-value trie map
   container with arbitrary key type

 * PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE (pattern-match-trie.sig) - signature extending
   TRIE with the capability of matching sequences with wildcards in
   them. Unlike TRIE, this exposes the types of the individual
   elements in each entry (e.g. char for a trie with string entries)

 * PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE_MAP (pattern-match-trie-map.sig) - signature
   extending TRIE_MAP with the capability of matching sequences with
   wildcards in them, like PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE

There are three core trie implementations provided, all implementing
trie-maps:

 * ListMTrieMapFn (list-mtrie-map-fn.sml) - a functor that takes a
   comparable element type and implements a PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE_MAP in
   which the entry type is a list of that element. The implementation
   uses a red-black tree map (from the SML/NJ library) at every trie
   node. This is better suited to wide, shallow trie structures than
   narrow, deep ones, but can be surprisingly efficient in both time
   and space. Insertion and enumeration are relatively cheap and
   lookup is relatively more expensive.

 * ListATrieMapFn (list-atrie-map-fn.sml) - a functor that takes an
   element type that can be mapped compactly onto a small integer
   range, and implements a PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE_MAP in which the entry
   type is a list of that element. The implementation uses an array
   (or rather a vector) at each node, extending the vector to span the
   range of inserted values. This may be better suited than
   ListMTrieMapFn to narrow, deep structures with small numbers of
   possible values at each node. Lookups are relatively cheap and
   insertion is relatively more expensive.

 * ListBTrieMapFn (list-btrie-map-fn.sml) - a functor that takes an
   element type that can be mapped compactly onto a small integer
   range, and implements a PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE_MAP in which the entry
   type is a list of that element. The implementation uses a
   bitmap-compressed semi-sparse array at each node. This is only
   suited to entries whose elements map sparsely into a small range.

These functors adapt them into set-type trie structures:

 * TrieFn (trie-fn.sml) - a functor that turns a TRIE_MAP into a TRIE

 * PatternMatchTrieFn (pattern-match-trie-fn.sml) - a functor that
   turns a PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE_MAP into a PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE

 * ListMTrieFn, ListATrieFn, ListBTrieFn (pattern-match-trie-fn.sml) -
   shorthands that turn an element type directly into a trie set (the
   set equivalents of *TrieMapFn)

And there are specialisations for string entries:

 * StringMTrieMap, StringATrieMap, StringBTrieMap
   (string-trie-map.sml) - trie-maps with string key type

 * StringMTrie, StringATrie, StringBTrie (string-trie.sml) - trie sets
   with string key type

 * StringTrieMap, StringTrie - aliases for StringMTrieMap, StringMTrie


2. PERSISTENT HASH MAP
----------------------

This library contains an implementation of a persistent hash map
structure. That is, a hash map in which every insertion or removal
returns a separate hash map, without modifying the one passed in, but
internally sharing any unmodified parts with it.

Like a classic hash table, the persistent hash map is unordered (keys
can be enumerated but not in any guaranteed order, and do not need to
be comparable) and requires that a hash function be provided for the
key type.

The implementation is a hash-array-mapped trie (HAMT) somewhat like
that popularised by the Clojure language. Hashes are 32-bit words and
collisions are handled using simple list chaining.

The main signature is:

 * PERSISTENT_HASH_MAP (persistent-hash-map.sig) - signature of a
   polymorphic-value hash map container with a fixed key type

And this is implemented by

 * PersistentHashMapFn (persistent-hash-map-fn.sml) - a functor that
   takes a hash key type and hash function and implements a
   PERSISTENT_HASH_MAP with that key type

There is a specialisation for string keys:

 * StringHashMap (string-hash-map.sml) - a PERSISTENT_HASH_MAP with
   string keys


3. PERSISTENT ARRAY AND QUEUE
-----------------------------

This library contains implementations of persistent array and queue
containers. These are immutable containers (like the standard vector)
that also support update, append, and pop-from-end operations. The
queue additionally supports prepend and pop-from-start, but in return
its plain iteration (foldl) is not as fast as the array. For both
containers, all of the update, append, prepend, and pop operations
take time independent of the container size.

The implementation uses an array-mapped-trie somewhat like that
popularised by the Clojure language. Both containers are limited in
size to 2^32 elements (by the implementation) or the maximum size of
Int.int (by the API), whichever is smaller. For the queue the
limitation is on current queue length, not on total number of
push/pops.

The main signatures are:

 * PERSISTENT_ARRAY (persistent-array.sig) - signature of a
   polymorphic-value persistent array container

 * PERSISTENT_QUEUE (persistent-queue.sig) - signature of a
   polymorphic-value persistent queue container

And these are implemented by

 * PersistentArray (persistent-array.sml) - a polymorphic-value
   persistent array container

 * PersistentQueue (persistent-queue.sml) - a polymorphic-value
   persistent queue container

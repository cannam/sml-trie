A persistent trie in Standard ML
================================

This is a fairly naive immutable implementation of a trie.

A trie is an ordered set container. It stores a set of entries of a
common type, which is some sort of sequence (vector, list, string
etc), filing them into a tree structure internally according to their
common prefixes.

As with a hash set or tree-backed set structure, membership testing is
generally fast. Unlike hash and tree sets, a with a trie you can also
quickly test whether any prefix of a given entry appears in the trie,
obtain the longest such prefix, and find all entries with a given
prefix. Like a tree-backed set but not a hash set, a trie supports
enumerating the entries in order.

This is a persistent or immutable implementation in the sense that add
and remove operations return a separate trie without modifying the one
passed in. The implementation is naive in that it simply uses a
red-black tree map (from the SML/NJ library) at each node. This isn't
all that memory efficient and is also probably better suited to wide,
shallow tries than narrow, deep ones. The structure was originally
written to provide indexes for an RDF triple store, where its
performance seems so far to be acceptable.

This library contains

 * A signature TRIE for tries with arbitrary entry types.

 * A signature PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE extending TRIE with the capability
   of matching sequences with wildcards in them. Unlike TRIE, this
   exposes the types of the individual elements in each entry
   (e.g. char for a trie of strings).

 * A functor ListEntryTrieFn which turns a list type into a structure
   implementing PATTERN_MATCH_TRIE (and so also implementing TRIE).

 * A structure StringTrie which uses ListEntryTrieFn to make a
   concrete trie of strings.

 * Basic unit tests.

With the MLton compiler, just run

 $ mlton test.mlb && ./test

To use in other projects, include trie.mlb from your MLB file.
